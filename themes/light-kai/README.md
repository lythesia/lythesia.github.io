### Light-kai(ライト-改)

A self-customized [Hexo] theme based on [Light]


#### Added Widgets

* archive - via [Hexo]'s `helper` utility
* about - currently equipped with `uesr-face` `mail` and `github` info

#### Added Lang

* `jp` - now can be configured in `_config.yml`, be careful with poor translations...

_if possible, me can make it a hexo-theme repo ? XD_
